# Week 1 Working with Code

### Study Buddy: Akbel

### About
This is our first class in HFY and this is our **first class exerices**. The objective is to get familiar with Github system and markdwow, today's special is creating a repo and turning it on. Akbel is there to guide and answer our questions.

### How
For this exercise, we have to make a file containing a short information of members in our team mates. What we do is create a new repo, clone it to gitkraken and make the markdown file about everyone and then push it back to Github. Edit is done later to make it better.
